## About
I have created this app to help study for the Google associate cloud engineer certification test.  I have gathered these questions from many sources. Some of those sources being from Google's practice exam, questions from Google Cloud Skills Boost course, and other various quizes on line. I did not create any of these questions and do not take credit for them.  This is a personal project for me but I am putting it on line in case others can get some use from it. 

I am also creating this as an open source project. I will update this read me file for specific instructions for open source once I have finished creating the main functionality of this application. I am open to any changes, be that adding more questions, improving efficiancy of code, styling etc.  I am not a UI/UX designer and don't have an eye for design.  I would love feed back on the styling/functionality of the application.  For now I'm going with cute colors I enjoy but, aside from it perhaps looking gaudy, I also am not sure if the colors will distract from learning/taking the quiz. I am open to all feedback!

## Next Steps for this application
I just started building this app so I have a lot to do to finish the app. 
Next steps are:
1. [x] Have buttons reflect right answers/wrong answers after user has selected choice 
2. [] Pick a set number for the quiz to go to and stop after that number has been reached.
3. [] Save users answers and show users selected answers vs correct answers when quiz is done
4. [] Have multiple quizes so user gets plenty of practice but isn't stuck taking 1 really long quiz.
5. [] Show them a percentage/"grade" for quize once finished
6. [] Open up GitHub repository to be open source
7. [] Perhaps update style to match Google's style
8. [/] Have a navigation with home page, about page and resource page
9. [] Refacter into smaller components to have better seperation of concerns
10. [] Add back end 
11. [/] Make responsive


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
